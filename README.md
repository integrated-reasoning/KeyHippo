## Core Functionality

KeyHippo addresses the challenge of incorporating API key authentication in Supabase applications without compromising the integrity of Row Level Security. It achieves this by extending the RLS framework to encompass both session-based and API key authentication methods within a unified security context. This approach eliminates the need for parallel security structures and maintains granular access control across authentication types.

Top features:

- Unified RLS policies supporting dual authentication methods
- SQL-based API key issuance
- Preservation of existing Supabase RLS implementations
- Essential API key lifecycle management

## Implementation

### Database Setup

1. Install the KeyHippo extension:

   ```sql
   select dbdev.install('keyhippo@keyhippo');
   create extension "keyhippo@keyhippo" version '0.0.5';
   ```

   Consult [database.dev](https://database.dev/keyhippo/keyhippo) for version updates.

2. Post-installation, KeyHippo functions become accessible within your database environment.

### Application Integration

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install keyhippo
```

## Usage Paradigms

### API Key Generation

```typescript
import { KeyHippo } from "keyhippo";

const keyHippo = new KeyHippo(supabaseClient);
const result = await keyHippo.createApiKey(userId, "Primary API Key");
```

### RLS Policy Implementation

Example of a policy supporting dual authentication:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "owner_access"
ON "public"."resource_table"
USING (
  auth.uid() = resource_table.owner_id
  OR auth.keyhippo_check(resource_table.owner_id)
);
```

This policy grants access when the user is authenticated via a session token (`auth.uid()`) or a valid API key associated with the resource owner (`auth.keyhippo_check()`).

### Additional Functionality

- `revokeApiKey`: Invalidate an existing API key
- `loadApiKeyInfo`: Retrieve metadata for existing keys
- `getAllKeyMetadata`: Comprehensive metadata for a user's API keys

## Process Diagrams

### API Key Creation Process

KeyHippo ensures that API keys are never stored in any form and cannot be reconstructed, even with access to the database.

```mermaid

    title: API Key Creation Process
    autonumber
    participant B as Browser
    participant S as Server
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant K as KeyHippo (Postgres)
    participant V as Supabase Vault

    B->>S: Initial request (e.g., page load)
    S->>S: Initialize Supabase client (URL, anonKey)
    S->>A: signInAnonymously() or signInWithProvider()
    A-->>S: Return Session (user.id, session.accessToken)
    B->>S: Request API key creation
    S->>S: Initialize KeyHippo instance
    S->>K: createApiKey(userId, keyDescription)
    K->>K: Verify auth.uid() matches userId
    K->>K: Generate UUID (jti) using gen_random_uuid()
    K->>K: Generate current timestamp and expiry (100 years from now)
    K->>K: Construct JWT body (role, aud, iss, sub, iat, exp, jti)
    K->>V: Retrieve user_api_key_secret for userId
    K->>V: Retrieve project_api_key_secret
    K->>V: Retrieve project_jwt_secret
    K->>K: Sign JWT with project_jwt_secret
    K->>K: Generate api_key = HMAC(jwt, user_api_key_secret, sha512)
    K->>K: Generate project_hash = HMAC(api_key, project_api_key_secret, sha512)
    K->>V: Store in vault.secrets: (secret: jwt, name: project_hash, description: keyDescription)
    K->>V: Store in auth.jwts: (secret_id: UUID of stored secret, user_id: userId)
    K-->>S: Return api_key (derived, not stored)
    S-->>B: Return API key to client

```

This design offers several key security benefits:

**Unique Key Generation:**

- Each invocation of `keyhippo.create_api_key` produces a distinct key, regardless of input consistency. This is achieved through the incorporation of UUIDs, timestamps, and multi-stage cryptographic operations.

**Temporal Uniqueness:**

- The use of high-precision timestamps in the key generation process ensures that keys created in rapid succession remain unique.

**Cryptographic Irreversibility:**

- The multi-stage hashing process, involving JWT signing and multiple HMAC operations, renders the key generation process cryptographically irreversible.

**Breach Resilience:**

- In the event of a database compromise, the stored hashes provide no mechanism to regenerate or deduce the original API keys.

**Separation of Concerns:**

- The utilization of Supabase Vault for secret management adds an additional layer of security, separating critical components of the key generation process.

This approach ensures that API keys remain secure and unrecoverable, even in scenarios involving potential database exposure or repeated generation attacks.

### Authenticated API Request Flow

This diagram illustrates the sequence of operations that occur when an API request is made using a KeyHippo-generated API key:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title: Authenticated API Request
    autonumber
    participant C as API Client
    participant S as Server
    participant K as KeyHippo (Postgres)
    participant P as Postgres RLS
    participant V as Supabase Vault

    C->>S: API request with API key in header
    S->>S: Extract API key from Authorization header
    S->>K: RPC: get_uid_for_key(user_api_key: apiKey)
    K->>V: Retrieve project_api_key_secret
    V-->>K: Return project_api_key_secret
    K->>K: Hash API key with project_api_key_secret
    K->>P: Look up hashed API key in vault.secrets
    P-->>K: Return matching secret_uuid if found
    K->>P: Query auth.jwts for user_id using secret_uuid
    P-->>K: Return user_id
    K-->>S: Return user_id
    alt user_id found
        S->>S: Supabase client authenticated with user_id
        S->>P: Execute query (including API key in header and user_id)
        P->>P: Evaluate RLS policy: (auth.uid() = owner_id) OR (keyhippo.key_uid() = owner_id)
        P->>K: Call keyhippo.key_uid()
        K->>K: Extract API key from request.headers
        K->>V: Retrieve project_api_key_secret
        V-->>K: Return project_api_key_secret
        K->>K: Hash API key with project_api_key_secret
        K->>P: Look up hashed API key in vault.secrets
        P-->>K: Return matching secret_uuid if found
        K->>P: Query auth.jwts for user_id using secret_uuid
        P-->>K: Return user_id
        K-->>P: Return user_id for RLS evaluation
        P->>P: Complete RLS policy evaluation
        P-->>S: Return RLS-filtered query results
        S-->>C: Return API response with data
    else user_id not found
        S-->>C: Return authentication error
    end

```

Note the seamless integration of KeyHippo's authentication process with Supabase's existing RLS framework. This approach ensures that API key authentication adheres to the same security policies as session-based authentication, maintaining a consistent security model across different authentication methods.

## Alpha Status

KeyHippo is currently in alpha status. We adhere to semantic versioning, and as such, KeyHippo will remain in alpha (versions < 0.1.0) until we've thoroughly validated its stability and feature completeness in production environments. During this phase, we welcome early adopters to provide feedback and report issues.

## Origins and Evolution

KeyHippo emerged from a pattern observed across Integrated Reasoning's Supabase projects: the need to reconcile API key authentication with Row Level Security policies. This challenge, also noted in Supabase's GitHub discussions (#4419), highlighted a gap in existing solutions.

We developed KeyHippo to address this, drawing insights from community discussions and approaches. The result is a streamlined, production-ready system for API key management in Supabase applications.
